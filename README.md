# Decentralized Task Bounty Board

## Overview

The **Decentralized Task Bounty Board** is a blockchain-powered platform where users can post tasks or bounties with rewards in **Algorand tokens**. Other users can claim these tasks, complete them, and receive the rewards — all managed securely through smart contracts.

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation:**  
   A user (task creator) posts a task with a description, difficulty level, and reward amount.

2. **Task Claiming:**  
   Another user (task solver) claims the task and begins working on it.

3. **Proof Submission:**  
   Once the task is completed, the solver submits proof of work.

4. **Smart Contract Verification:**  
   A smart contract validates the submission and automatically transfers the reward to the solver.

## Think of it like...

A decentralized version of freelancing platforms like **Fiverr** or **Upwork**, where everything — from task posting to payment — is governed by smart contracts, not centralized entities.
